# English-Summative-Roblox-Game
For my end of year English project we were tasked with the job to create a representation connecting the themes and ideas of at least three of the books we read that year. and how it connected to our our personal lives. I chose to use a Roblox Game to convey these themes and ideas as I had recently played Roblox with my friends.

Breen AP/IB World Lit. and Comp. 1 HL–Summative Project (15 points total)

“What surprised me most was the way in which she'd ended up understanding her own life.”
–Gabriel García Márquez

Rationale: 
I showed you Le Hérisson because I think it’s a good reminder that being human involves the search for meaning. Not all of us assess life’s purpose or value as explicitly, consciously, or desperately (I hope) as Paloma does, but we all make choices as we move through our existence. 

Those choices imply some sort of framework or understanding that we operate based on, whether or not we acknowledge or are even conscious of it. Similarly, we are also the narrators of our lives–we tell ourselves the story of our circumstances, relationships, choices, consequences, etc. back to ourselves, and in doing so, we shape our understanding of that experience and its meaning.

Purpose: 
My goal with this project is for you to consider your own narratives and to evaluate how you understand these key human questions of meaning at this point in your life. In order to do so, I want you to engage with three of the works we’ve studied this year as your foundation for an otherwise more personal style of writing. I expect you to be writing in first person and regarding your experience, but I want you to use these works as a framework for doing so. 

I’m not demanding that you agree with any or all of them–just engage specifically, insightfully, and with a focus on the details as always, both regarding the writing of our authors and your own thoughts. You could be focusing on the more thematic level arguments of the works, or maybe there’s an element of one of these novels that resonates with your life experience, or one that completely contradicts your understanding. Get into those details! Consider this to be an intellectual conversation between you and the authors and characters we’ve encountered this year. 

Execution: 
So what do you actually need to do? The project has two parts–between the two of them, you need to engage with three texts in total. So, if you include one text in the creative piece, you need to incorporate an additional two in your written reflection, for example. 

Creative response (7 points)–in the creative mode of your choosing (art, collage, writing, dance, music, sculpture, film, comic, etc.), express your current understanding of these questions: 

How do you understand the meaning or purpose of your life presently?
What ideas or experiences have your focus? Why? 
How do you understand your experiences, good and bad? 
How do you approach the future? 
What makes a meaningful life?
	How do the works we’ve studied inform your answers to these questions?

Writing (8 points)--in a personal essay of 400 words (minimum), do the following: 
a) engage with the texts we have studied this year as you explore and explain your own thinking in relation to the questions above and to the ideas our authors present. Be specific and engage with the actual words as always. 
b) explain the choices you made in your creative response–why did you do what you did? How does it communicate what you intended it to communicate? How does it connect to the three works? Here’s where you get to do justice to your creative piece and to ensure that I fully understand your vision for it. 

Remember, by the end of this project, you need to have engaged with three of the works from the year. 

Grading: 
I’m going to grade this out of 15 points holistically–here’s what I’m looking for: 

attention to detail
care and thoughtfulness
knowledge and understanding of the texts (note: I’m not looking for a Response Paragraph, but when you engage with the text, you should be precise and demonstrate a nuanced understanding)
aesthetic appeal
purposeful relationship between your creative choices and what you’re aiming to communicate 
tidiness (proofreading, creative projects that reflect care)

# Connection Between Game and Assignment
Why should I live?
That is half of the foundation for every question we try to answer in our lifetime. Kitchen, No Exit, and 1984 while all having unique themes ,they too looked to the same question. What I say next is not absolute but rather where I am in my exploration for the answer to this question. To answer the question I had to answer another question. Why was I created? God being a Being of Love created man to love them. So then it is out of Love that I exist. However, now that I exist, why should I continue to exist in that love? What purpose do I serve in it? What am I meant to do in it? If all of creation is from an act of Love, then all of creation is just one clay ball of Love. That being the case, I have a few options, I can roll over in spite of the love or I can build in the love.  

When I fail, get rejected, someone hurts me or I am just angry I could respond by hurting others. In doing this I scrape away at this large clayball. Yet that doesn’t have any meaning since it can be easily covered. In exchange I could also choose to build more with the clay I have. Yet what I build through kind acts and gestures could be squashed by one hand. So does that too matter? No matter what I choose to do, the impact does not change the grand scheme of life.  It’s as if we live in Sartre’s hell where our actions lack meaning. If by some means I decide to build or destroy there is no difference if the action can be undone? As what gives an action meaning is its impact. So an impactless action is pointless. Thus is our life pointless? NO. I apologize but I told a small lie that led us to this incorrect conclusion. You see clay is finite, its natural lifespan is finite, with each action upon it, the air exchanges life from it. Eventually, the clay will become rock solid and changes to its form will only tear it down. The actions we take create indents in our life. These indents pave the way for more creation or destruction to occur. Through these indents slowly but surely one strives to their final piece. The final piece is perhaps the only absolute unchangeable thing in one’s life besides one birth. 

The idea of the final piece prompts a vital question. “What should my final piece be?”Over the course of my life I have realized the only work that will satisfy me is something that can help others. So I want my final piece to be one that allows others to joyfully make their final piece. However I hope for more than that. I want my final piece to serve as a cape of hope to others allowing them to strive to be better despite how much they have paved in their clay. A cape that symbolizes a past of endurance, a future of hope and a present of joy. In understanding this dream, I must live as that’s the only way it may be realized. So perhaps why one should live can only be fully answered when they have a dream, a hope, a desire. Perhaps this is why man lacks aspects in their lives as if we had everything from the beginning we would never want thus we would be unable to dream hence life would be pointless. It’s similar to Kitchen’s idea of darkness being necessary for the light to shine.

Now through understanding my purpose a second question must be answered. “How should I live?”
This is the second half to the foundation for every question we try to answer in our lifetime. After Identifying where one wishes to venture to, they must chart a path that leads them there. However, how does one chart a path in uncharted waters? Each life is unique so no man can predict the peaks and troughs they will encounter across their journey.Yet our natural human instinct tells us to predict the unpredictable in order to avoid pain. Yet sometimes pain must be undertaken to stride in the correct path. Hence in the short simulation one must fail a few times in order to cross the sea or red bricks. In the sea we are free to ride any stream however some streams will only lead to demise yet we perhaps can only see that by riding it. 

 In creating this project I was assured that I would be making an Artificial Intelligence Cover Parody regarding three books of my choosing. To the point where I learned the technology that went behind the systems and made some practice demos. Yet upon taking a break from the technology I returned and it wasn’t working so I was forced to utilize a different system which led to a whole slew of issues. In the end, I had to leave this stream of an idea and step back. For a while my brain had gone blank. However I reflected not on the failed stream but on my enjoyed experiences with my friends and family. Thus, inspiration for my project came from a place in which I hid from it while playing with my friends. Through experiences like these I have come to realize that our control of the sea we ride is very little. At any moment we could be consumed whole and that would be the end of our work. The most one could do is stay vigilant and observant, always ready to take a turn when given a good opportunity. To simulate this I utilized a recreation of the room in No Exit. The player is trapped by all conventional means yet if they abandon their fixed mindset they are able to escape. In addition, I also engineered the game so that the player could abruptly die through touching an invisible block. To showcase the unpredictable nature of life. 

In going back to my hopes, one thing I have realized is that endurance is vital to my success. The pains of life will tear at you physically however those can sometimes be overcomed. What is most dangerous to harm is one’s mental and spiritual state. They perhaps serve as the foundation for who one is so in tearing them one slowly loses themself Thus one of man’s greatest struggles must be to keep them in them intact. As Dimmesdale is proof of the mental and spiritual states cannot be torn or harmed or else the whole man will fall. That is why it’s important to keep being you in the face of adversity. To keep loving and hoping in the times when it is difficult is necessary, “As it when one can’t, they must”. To showcase a monster will chase you when you activate it. This monster represents your trials and tribulations. 

However, you can’t fight this monster. You alone cannot harm him. I decided this as one can’t face their own challenges by themself. As humans the greatest gift we have is being incomplete from birth and through living and connecting we are able to complete ourselves. So there will be weapons and abilities which represent your faith, family and friends coming to help you. It is up to you to put them in the position to help by opening up and showing them a path. So put yourself in a position in which the monster can be destroyed by the abilities. Interestingly kitchen, no exit, and The Scarlet Letter all played into this idea as well. In Kitchen, Yuichi and Mikage could not overcome their grief without embracing the other. Eriko also introduced the idea that in taking care of something we complete ourselves, which makes us stronger., In No Exit they all are intertwined ll unable to satisfy themself. Albeit this was on the negative side of our need for connection since it was rooted in Bad Faith and the Gaze. However, it still shows our human need for other humans. In the Scarlet Letter, DImmesdale is only able to overcome his decaying half torpid state by fully embracing his family. Pearl is only able to acquire empathy when she is not alienated by her father but embraced in the eye of the town in the very place that isolated her.  

Upon reaching the island you will notice a mountain. This was my representation for the journey I walk now. It is full of turmoil yet beautiful views and experiences that make it worth it. However when climbing the ladder to the next stage you will notice it is impossible. There is an invisible barrier that halts you. I feel this is where I am now in my life, halted by a barrier I must soar through. I can;t simply walk past it, I want to crack the barrier with all my might, but perhaps this will be a failed stream and I simply must walk past this barrier. I will only find this out by moving forward and living. 

My humble abode is hidden amongst the trees and within the mist. It’s cut off from the working of time and reality. It’s symbolic of my heart in a sense of my heart and mind. It is very much reachable but what goes on within it is often confusing. Through experiences and reflection I wish to be rid of the mist and have a full understanding of myself. 

The school represents a place where connections and knowledge are acquired. Thus you are able to find abilities to help you fight off the monsters that represent the adversities of life.

As you go further onto my mental plane you will be met by a group of people that you cannot interact with. These people represent the alienating feeling that grows due to my social anxiety. While they look like they are having a blast, I am unable to reach them due to being scared. Hester’s alienation was also due to fear, not her fear but the town’s fear that she would tear down the traditional norms which they found comfort in. No matter the reason, alienation only serves to rob people of a world they could love, if they could experience it.

Overall, the game is rather difficult. However life is as well, and it doesn’t get easier you just get stronger. So it will take a while to fully explore the world but by the time one is done doing so, they will have improved as a result. That is my summative understanding of the books our class read this year.
